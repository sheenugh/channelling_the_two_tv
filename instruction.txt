Given: A UML Class Diagram below:
Required: Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from 
Class TV and will produce the following output:
tv1 channel is 30 and volume level is 3
tv2 channel is 3 and volume level is 2


- INSTANCE VARIABBLES
channel : int
volume_level: int
on: bool


- VARIABLES FOR EACH INSTANCE METHODS
