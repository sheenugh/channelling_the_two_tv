# Chanelling the Two TV
# Goal of this Program
Given: A UML Class Diagram below. <br>
Required: Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from 
Class TV and will produce the following output: <br>
tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3 <br>
tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2 <br>
<br>
INSTANCE VARIABLES
channel : int <br>
volume_level: int <br>
on: bool <br>
<br>
VARIABLES FOR EACH INSTANCE METHODS<br>

turn_off(): NOne <br>
get_channel(): int <br>
set_channel((channel: int)): None <br>
get_volume() : int <br>
set_volume((volume_level: int)): None <br>
channel_up(): none <br>
channel_down(): none  <br>
volume_up(): none <br>
volume_down(): none <br>
<br>
DESCRIPTIONS<br>
The current channel (1 to 120) of this TV <br>
The current channel volume level ( 1 to 7) of this  TV <br>
Indicates whether this TV is on/off <br>
Construct a default TV object <br>
Turn on this TV <br>
Turn off this TV <br>
Returns the channel for this TV <br>
Set a new channel for this TV <br>
Gets the volume level for this TV <br>
Sets a new volume for this TV <br>
Increase the channel by 1 <br>
Decrease the channel by 1 <br>
Increase the volume level by 1 <br>
