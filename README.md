# channelling_the_two_tv
# Goal of this Program:
Given: A UML Class Diagram below:
Required: Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from 
Class TV and will produce the following output:
tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3
tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2

- INSTANCE VARIABLES
channel : int
volume_level: int
on: bool

- VARIABLES FOR EACH INSTANCE METHODS
TV()
turn_on(): None
turn_off(): NOne 
get_channel(): int
set_channel((channel: int)): None
get_volume() : int
set_volume((volume_level: int)): None
channel_up(): none
channel_down(): none 
volume_up(): none
volume_down(): none

DESCRIPTIONS
